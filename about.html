           <b> Our Story</b>
            Founded in 2021 by Riya Kapoor, a passionate coffee enthusiast and entrepreneur, Brewed Awakening was born out of a dream to bring a unique coffee culture to India. After traveling to coffee plantations in Coorg, Chikmagalur, and Kerala, Riya was inspired to craft a café experience that combined local flavors, artisanal brews, and a welcoming atmosphere.
            Starting from a single outlet in Mumbai, Brewed Awakening has now expanded to Bangalore, Pune, Delhi, and Nagpur, bringing together authentic Indian coffee, handcrafted food, and a creative community.
